**Step Two: Remotely Connecting

The command ssh enables remote connection. To activate remote connection, use the following command:
ssh {the name of a specific cse 15l account name}@ieng6.ucsd.edu
If it is the first time to log in, we should type "yes" to enable connecting.
After that, enter the password to get access into the account.
We can also see the record for login to the specific remote account.

**Step Three: Trying Some Commands

There are many basic commands that can be used in VScode to control the remote account. The results on the remote computer will be different from our own computer.
Useful commands include the following:
pwd// shows current directory
ls// List all the files and directory 
Mkdir // make/created a new directory 
Cd +(directory name)  // changed current directory 
Cdâ€¦ //will change your current directory to the parent directory. 
Rm -r // remove directory
